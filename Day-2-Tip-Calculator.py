#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill_amt = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip_amt = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
split_ppl = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
bill_tip_split = float((bill_amt / split_ppl) * (1+tip_amt/100))
print("Each person should pay: $",round(bill_tip_split,2))
